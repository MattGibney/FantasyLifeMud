# Fantasy Life MUD

This project is my love letter to what I consider to be oner of the greatest
games ever made. Fantasy Life for the Nintendo 3DS. Within this project, I do
not intend to make an exact copy of the game. I will be leaving out the entirety
of the story mode. My plan is to re-create the world of Fantasy Life as a MUD. 

I have decided not to use an existing framework to build this MUD. Instead, I
will be doing it from scratch. This is, of corse, nuts and there is no way that
I will ever complete this task. For me however, it's much more about the journey
and having somewhere to vent my need to work on something.

There is no real planning going into this. I'm honestly going to make the whole
thing up as I go along and hope for the best.


### Development Rules

1) This game is designed around a terminal window that is 80 characters wide.
   All text MUST be formatted appropriately. Text must wrap around at 80 
   characters and be justified to start after 2 spaces and end with 2 spaces.
